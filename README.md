# TrainWebApp
Created a website where customers can make reservations for trains on the North East Corridor Line. All reservations are stored in a database schema. Customers can view their reservations, view detailed information about trains running (such as how many seats are available, if trains have been delayed, price, starting station and ending station, etc), and ask customer representatives any questions that they have. Customer reps can edit reservations, update train schedules, and answer customer questions.
